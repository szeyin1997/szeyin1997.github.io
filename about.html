<p>I’m pursuing Mechanical Engineering in University of California, Berkeley as part of a dual degree partnership with my home university, Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.</p>

<p>I am a self-taught UX designer who enjoys creating impactful yet meaningful experiences for users. I enjoy problem-solving and I am passionate about making peoples’ lives a little better and a little easier. Thus, when I discovered User Experience and Product Design a while back, I completely fell in love with it.</p>

<p>Having worked in/with various roles from marketing, UX, engineering and product, I believe I have developed an interdisciplinary skill set with strong problem-solving skills, allowing me to understand problems and design solutions in a holistic way.
</p>
<p>I’m always up for a chat about UX, life and everything else.</p>
