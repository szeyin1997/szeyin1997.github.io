        The Problem
        </h3>
        <div id="content">
        In my Design Innovation class, we were tasked with creating a solution to a problem in mobility. After a few rounds of ideation, my team and I have settled on the issue of travel planning as we realise that we all had different hacks around travel planning but none was as efficient and effective as we liked it to be.
The entire travelling process should be enjoyable and a time for people to relax and explore but people still worry and and get stressed out from planning their trip. There are currently plenty of resources out there to aid people in making a more informed decision in terms of trip planning but none that caters people’s individual preferences. How can we make trip planning more enjoyable and stress-free yet effective?

        User Research
        </h3>
        <div id="content">
        <p>We conducted interviews around Berkeley Campus to learn more about how are people currently planning their trips and what are their priorities when it comes to trip planning. We are targetting users who want the flexibility of self-planned travels.</p>
            <p>Research Findings:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Current ways of travel planning includes using travel guides such as Tripadvisor, Youtube videos or blogposts to gather a list of potential locations and areas. Users then map their route out manually either through Google maps or a physical map.</li>
            <li>Users felt that the hardest part of planning is optimizing for distance and time</li>
            <li>Generic travel guides are good in providing the most popular areas but insufficient in providing customised places of interest</li>
            <li>Users want things to be planned but also flexible</li>
            </ul>
        <p>We found out that most users currently plan their trips using travel guides such as Tripadvisor or Yelp followed by mapping their route out manually using Google maps. Users found this process frustrating and time-consuming but do not know of a better alternative to trip planning.</p>

            <h3>Sketches and Ideation</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="content">
            <p>We decided to focus on convenience and customisability for our solution because they are the root of the frustrations of our users. Therefore, our solution focuses on:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>
                Search + Recommendations : Users can either search for a place they are interested in or the app will recommend places according to the user’s interest and preferences</li>
            <li>
                Mapping: Our solution maps an optimal route to the user’s trip based on proximity, operating hours and average time spent
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>With my user research guiding the product features, I sketched out a rough userflow and did a simple wireframe mockup on Whimsical.</p>
            <p>We walked the users through the flow – users would key in their preferences (E.g Budget, intensity of travel, insta-worthy, adventurous etc). A list of recommendations would appear upon entering of preferences. The user can either search for a specific place if they already had a location in mind or look at our curated locations that is generated based on data provided by others. Once satisfied, the platform will auto-generate an optimal route based on proximity and operating hours of locations. However, users can still make changes to the routes. There were also other side features such as viewing and ‘following’ a friend’s itinerary.</p>

        <div id="title"><h3>Feedback</h3></div>
        <div id="content">
        <p>Upon running through the flow with a few users, these were some of the feedback received:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>“The social aspect of the itinerary was very interesting and possibly an area for you to focus more on as your value proposition”</li>
            <li>“I think that the mapping feature is great and it’s so shocking when you realise that there isn’t anything like that out there”</li>
            <li>“I can definitely see a use for this and I foresee a huge potential in this as a social travel planning platform”</li>
            <li>“This is something I will definitely use”</li></ul>
            
            <p>From the insights of our various interviews, we decided to prioritise the mapping feature and develop more on the social aspect. Even though, the features were not entirely the same as what we had planned initially, our new product features resonates even stronger with our user persona now – looking at friends’ itineraries for inspiration and duplicating them allow users to create a more customised itinerary as they have common interests. Doing this will quicken the user’s planning process as the user no longer have to create an itinerary from scratch.</p>

        <p>Based on an understanding of how the app would work and its main features, I created high fidelity prototypes using Sketch and Figma.</p>
            <p>Below are some examples of the screens during high fidelity prototyping. The designs went through multiple iterations after gaining user feedback.</p>

            <p>Users can choose to duplicate itineraries that he/she prefers and customise it from there, reducing effort of creating an itinerary from scratch yet allowing flexibility. After which, tripset generates an ideal route of locations for each day based on proximity of each location and its operating hours, which is editable by users. This greatly adds to the convenience of travel planning and users no longer have to spend hours mapping out a route.</p></div>
